# Evidence Based Data Analysis 

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing factors influencing infant birth weight in first-time mothers. The study utilizes a dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from the year 2018, with a specific focus on low birth-weight (LBW) infants.

Goals

1. To identify significant factors affecting infant birth weight.
2. To understand the relationship between maternal health, behaviors, and infant birth weight.
Dataset and Methods

Data Source: CDC's 2018 U.S. birth data.
Variables: 15 key variables were selected, including maternal BMI, smoking status, education, race, and infant's sex.
Analysis Tools: R programming with libraries like ggplot2, dplyr, and hexbin.

Key Findings

1. The data revealed correlations between maternal factors and birth weight.
2. Notable relationships include the impact of maternal BMI, smoking status, age, and race on birth weight.
3. The study also analyzed the timing of prenatal care and its influence on birth weight.

Graphs and Visualizations

1. Histograms and density plots of birth weight distribution.
2. Hexbin and violin plots to visualize the relationship between maternal factors and birth weight.
3. Linear models to explore correlations and trends in the data.

Conclusion

The study provides insights into how maternal health and lifestyle factors contribute to infant birth weight, emphasizing the importance of prenatal care and maternal well-being for infant health outcomes.
